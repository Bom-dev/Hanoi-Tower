# Hanoi Tower

## Tower of Hanoi
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where the objective is to move a stack of discs from one rod to another. 

There are three rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time
Every move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack
No disk can be put on top of a smaller disk

### Technology
HTML/CSS & JavaScript

### Goal as a user
- As a user, I want to move all the disks to another stack, so that I can move them one by one. 
- As a user, I want to get a high score, so that I can move as little as possible.
- As a user, I want to see clearly if something is clicked, so that I can use css effects to make it clear when something is being used.

### Goal as a developer
- HTML / CSS
1. Display titles / scores / message tap / refresh button. 
2. Put modal button including description about the game. 
3. Build three stack and number of disks. 
4. Make disks clickable and movable. 

- JavaScript
1. Get a value from what the user clicks and where the user wants it to move.
2. Display the movement of disks.
3. Set limitations for these:
4. The user only can move a disk one time.
5. A disk cannot be placed on the smaller disk.
6. Count and display the number of the movement.
7. Display a message when the user completes it.

### Process
1.  Set basic elements for making frames of the game.
2. Make buttons to use.
3. Activate disks when a user chooses.
4. Move the active disk to another stack.
5. Adjust disks direction in the container.
6. Adjust disk width.
7. Set limitations for disks moving.
8. Create a selection to choose a number of disks.
9. Set a basic timer.
10. Set scoring based on time.
